# Implementations of some algorithms and data strutures

## Motivation
To satisfy my long term quest to learn algos and ds as well as to fight the inferiority complex infront of cs grads as I had taken electronics & communication major for graduation.

## What's in it?

I'm trying to implement the algorithms in CPP as well as in Ruby as I learn.

## Algorithms

The below is the implemented list of algorithms.
  - binary search
  - sorting
    - bubble sort
    - selection sort
    - insertion sort
    - merge sort
    - heap sort
    - quick sort
    - counting sort
    - radix sort
  - priority queue


## Data Structures

Given below is the list of DS that I have tried implementing.
  - stack
  - linked list
